    <!-- Allow HTTP for all connections during development/testing -->
    <!-- Production validation happens in UrlValidator.kt to restrict HTTP to:
         - Private IP ranges: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 127.x.x.x
         - .local domains (mDNS/Bonjour)
         
         This permissive config is necessary because Android's Network Security Config
         doesn't support IP-based rules, only domain patterns.
         We handle security through application-level validation instead. -->
